    <p class="ri">Nature is the connection between the physical world surrounding us and the life inside us. Nature is God’s most precious and valuable gift to humans. It is the principal source of all essential nutrients for all living things on the planet. Nature is one of the topics on which we might be asked to write a paragraph. Check the samples provided in the article to learn how to write one on your own.Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These disasters, which occur as a result of natural causes, have resulted in significant damage. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air to our health cannot be overstated. Nature has a variety of beneficial effects on our bodies. For recuperation and vacations, people choose natural settings. People prefer to raise their children in the countryside in the United States. Their primary goal is to introduce their children to the benefits of natural beauty.</p>
